Title: World IPv6 Launch day woke me up

<p>Early this morning I got alerts from several of our nagios installations saying they couldnt reach www.google.com. I logged into a production machine from my phone and cheked it was still talking to the internet properly. They went back to sleep with an inkling this maybe an issue with <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org/">World IPv6 Launch</a> day.</p> 

<p>When I woke up refreshed and ready for action I went an investigated and it would seem that on our servers check_ping will default to resolving the AAAA record which isnt good when you dont have IPv6 connectivity. So the easy fix is specify -4 to check ping. Although im tempted to just remove the check since if the internet is that broken the alert cant be sent anyway.</p>
